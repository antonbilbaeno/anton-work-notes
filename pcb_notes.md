#PCB Design Checklist
## Before beginning layout
1. Define min. trace/space
2. Define min. via diameter
3. Define min. via annular ring
--> Using all of these requirements, pick a manufacturer.
<-- Or, pick a manufacturer first and use their requirements.

## Board Finishes
1. HASL - One of the most common finishes, Hot Air Solder Leveling is cheap.
2. ENIG - Electroless nickel immersion gold consist of an electroless nickel plating covered with a thin layer of immersion gold. The gold protects the nickel from oxidation.
  - ENIG is superior in:
    1. flatness (for applying stencils, placing BGAs and other small flat, leadless packages, flatness is extremely helpful)
    2. oxidation
    3. untreated membrane switches and contact points

## Silkscreen
1. Make sure silkscreen is mirrored on bottom side
2. Always vector font
3. Check minimum silkscreen thickness/ratio/width
    - Depends on mfr, but ~10 mil line thickness is a good start

## Last minute checks
Using pads at a pitch of less than 0.65mm? <br>
