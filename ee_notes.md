Vias
-Aspect Ratio = 6:1 (minimum, ideally). Bigger is always better, more reliable.
-Never place in pad (unless plated).
--Placing a via close to a pad may cause solder to wick down into the via, creating an unreliable (mechanically and electrically) solder joint.
--It is possible to place a mask between the lead and via to create a barrier to prevent solder flow. However, attention needs to be paid to manufacturing tolerances to ensure that solder mask can be placed in such a manner.


Tented Vias
-Pros: can put silkscreen
-Cons: no longer a test point
-Tent ONLY one side of via
--Otherwise, contaminants or gas can build up inside via and explode during reflow
-Tented vias need to be small enough for the soldermask to bridge the drill hole
-Encroached vias only cover the annular ring and can be as big or small as needed.
-Plated (or filled) vias are always the best choice, though expensive

Stencil Aperture
-Aspect Ratio:
--laser-cut stencils >0.66
--electroform and NicAlloy stencils >0.55
--electroform and NicAlloy with nanocoat > 0.5
--electroform with nanocoat >0.43
