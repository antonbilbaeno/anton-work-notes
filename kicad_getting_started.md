### Using Eeschema
1. Open KiCad.
  - From here you have access to eight-stand alone software tools:
    1. Eeschema
    2. Schematic Library Editor
    3. Pcbnew
    4. PCB Footprint Editor
    5. GerbView
    6. Bitmap2Component
    7. PCB Calculator
    8. Pl Editor
2. Create a new project.
  - File -> New Project -> New Project
    - The project file will automatically take the extension ".pro"
    - KiCad prompts do create a dedicated directory, click Yes to confirm. All project files will be saved in this directory.
3. Begin by creating a schematic. This is the first button on the left.
4. Click on the **Page Settings** icon on the top toolbar. Set page size to **A4** and the title as **whatever you want**. 
  - This information will populate the schematic at the bottom right corner.
5. Save the whole schematic project.
  - File -> Save Schematic Project
